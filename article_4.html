# Why AI Will Never Rule The World
![AI Image](article_4_thumbnail.png)
<br>
**Since the advent of ChatGPT in recent years, many people have feared that AI will soon overtake humans. In this article I would like to explain how that is not the case, and maybe even instill hope in you that the human species is better than you may have originally thought**
<br><br>
If you were to google "ai" at the time of my writing this, most likely one of the first results will be something about AI taking over the world. Although there have been numerous recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the realm of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and content generation, I am very certain that we are nowhere near "AGI", and we probably don't event want it.
<br><br>
Lately in my spare time, I have been watching a show called "Frieren: Beyond Journey's End". While I think that the show is very well made, I would like to bring attention to some specific details which pertain to the philosophy of AI. In the show, several times demons are fought by the main characters. Something that they always mention is that, although the demons speak like humans, and often seem to be emotional, they aren't actually using language to communicate, they use it to fool humans.
<br><br>
I think that this concept of the use of language is extremely close to how AI (Such as ChatGPT) communicate. They do not do so as a means to communicate with humans, they are trained to replicate human speech. And any seemingly thought provoking sentences of paragraphs generated by the AI, are likely taken from something that a human said in the training data.
<br><br>
What I am trying to get at, is that AI isn't trained to communicate with humans, it's trained to fool them. Although I think that Large Language Models have a benefit to society, in that they can give relatively accurate results to questions that may take some time to google; it's important to realize that most of the hype on AI right now is "fake", in that it's being generated for reasons that aren't realistic.
<br><br>
You may have further questions regarding why I think that most of the hype around AI right now is "fake". In a similar case, during years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was something called a "bull rush", but the target of the bull rush wasn't AI, it was Cryptocurrencies. Of course, after the pandemic, the hype was nearly gone. People thought that Crypto was the next evolution of Currency, but it ended up just being a means to launder money.
<br><br>
AI serves a similar purpose, the people interested in AI are simply using it as a means to make some short term profit. That isn't to say that AI has no purpose, it will become very useful in the years to come. However, it's not going to be the end of civilization.
<br><br>
Humans have a superpower, we are one of the only species on Earth with the capacity to manufacture tools that can aid us in survival. This is our superpower, and we have used it to propel ourselves so far beyond the rest of life on Earth, that we have begun damaging the Earth itself. Something important to realize is that a tool created by humans that doesn't benefit us, is a worthless tool. We don't build tools that can't serve us any purpose.
<br><br>
So what is the purpose of AI? Well it's true that it can be used to generate new content, but what good is the content if people dislike it. It's also true that it can generate text for us based off of training data from the internet, but it's been shown that the information it provides is often unreliable, and usually contains very little of value.
<br><br>
It doesn't matter whether the AI can "ace" medical exams with 8000 multiple choice questions, or generate 10,000 word essays on how to perform brain surgery. Can the AI perform the brain surgery, of course not, it's "beyond the scope of the AI". So what is the machine purpose then, it seems that there is much less to AI then people believe.
<br><br>
I know that this article may come off to many as slightly incoherent, or long winded. But there is a reason that I bring up all of these seemingly minor problems that pertain to AI. As I previously stated, tools with no purpose are useless to humans, and much of the "hype" around AI is about those tools that serve little to no purpose, while the truly impressive tools created with AI go under the radar.
<br><br>
Thank you for reading, I hope that this article brings you some hope about humans, and please don't invest in AI startups, they are probably going to fail.
