# Getting Started With Machine Learning

## READ THIS FIRST
So you want to learn AI, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc. This article is absolutely for you, I will be going over everything that you need to know about AI, and how to get started. 
There are many different paths which you can take with regards to learning AI, since it covers many different fields such as Mathematics, Computer Science, even Evolutionary Biology!
With this in mind, it's important to realize that there is no "perfect roadmap" and anyone telling you that their roadmap is better is probably lying.
I am not going to call this article a roadmap, as that would impy a rigorous schedule with very specific tasks. This article will simply describe the skills that you need to be able to apply Machine Learning to your own projects.
There is a plethora of "roadmap" material on sites such as Youtube, Linkedin, and other such websites. Usually the people making this content either do so for monetary gain, or to make themselves look better for the job market.
Although there are often useful resources included withing these roadmaps, they usually lie about how long you should be spending on learning different skills. Remember **Learning is an endurance game, not a race**, and learning a little bit each day will propel you much further than people who get burnt out studying 12 hrs per day for approximately 2-3 months.
This article will be formatted with the learning resources first, and after I will describe the general skills which you should be looking to gain from them. This article doesn't assume anything about your ability in math, programming, etc.

## Learning Resources
### Kaggle / Kaggle Learn
I cannot emphasize enough the sheer power that Kaggle provides to people who want to learn Machine Learning, or Data Analytics. **Everything** on Kaggle is free, with not a single paywall gating learning resources (the only payments that they advertize is for cloud computing, which also has a free tier). I will be going over two main sections of Kaggle: Learn and Competitions.

#### Kaggle Learn
Kaggle learn is a great way to learn Machine Learning if you are looking for a "Zero to Hero" method to learn. They start with beginner python courses, and progress all the way to NLP, and Computer Vision. The learning resources are split into chunks which contain the separate separate topics. If you are just getting started with programming as a whole, I would reccomend starting with the beginner courses, and progressing from there. If you are pretty familiar with programming, you could start with the Machine Learning specific courses. When you complete any of the courses, you are given a certificate which you could display on your portfolio if you wanted to.

#### Kaggle Competitions
I wouldn't recommend working on any of the competitions if you are new to programming, as you will probably have a hard time and give up. If you already have some programming experience, then you could try a competition, but remember that it's more important to learn what you are doing, rather than increase your placing on the leaderboard (yes, there is worldwide leaderboards). Kaggles competitions are split between very difficult professional competitions with prize pools, and beginner competitions with no prize pool, but usually are more approachable to beginners.

### Khan Academy
Although it may seem rather surprising to people who are new to Machine Learning, mathematics plays a huge part in the technology behind the scenes. Fortunately for people who don't like math (such as myself) much of the math is abstracted away by most of the ML Frameworks. However, if you really want to learn how ML works I would HIGHLY recommend refreshing your math skills. The most important math I would recommend is Statistics, and Formal Logic (which isn't on Khan Academy). If you are more math-savvy, then I would recommend you also take the Calculus courses on Khan Academy, since Deep Learning is almost entirely built upon the idea of Derivation. I won't be linking Khan Academy here, as it's very easy to find, but for anyone who is interested, just google "Khan Academy".
